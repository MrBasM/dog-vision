# 🐶 Dog Vision - Dog Breed Classifier

A deep learning project to classify dog breeds using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), built in Google Colab as part of the **Complete A.I. Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery** course.

## 📓 Project Overview

This project trains a CNN model to recognize dog breeds from images. It uses TensorFlow/Keras and is implemented in a single Colab notebook.

- 🔗 Notebook: `dog_vision.ipynb`
- 📦 Dataset: [Kaggle Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data)

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Google Colab (GPU)
- Data preprocessing with `ImageDataGenerator`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Download and unzip the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data)
3. Upload the data to Colab or mount Google Drive
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model
